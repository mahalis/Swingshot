Hi! Thanks for downloading my game. I made it in about eight days for 7dfps 2020: https://itch.io/jam/7dfps-2020

You can find me on Twitter at @mahalis or by email at mahalis@gmail.com.

I made the code and art using the following:

• Unreal Engine
• Houdini
• Substance Designer
• Affinity Photo
• EmberGen


The sound and music are by ssccaappeeggooaatt, whose other work you can find here:

The font used for the title is Heroes Legend by imagex <imagex1@wanadoo.fr>; the menu and HUD text is set in Louis George Cafe by Chen Yining <yiningchen23@gmail.com>.


How to play:

Grapple into the large orbs to burst them and earn points. Attach to the floating grapple points by aiming at them and holding down the mouse button (if you’re using a mouse) or the trigger (if you’re using a gamepad).


Controls:
• To move, use WASD on a keyboard or the left gamepad joystick.
• To look around, use the mouse or the right gamepad joystick.
• To attach to a grapple point you’re looking at, press and hold the left or right mouse button, or press the left or right gamepad trigger.
• To jump, use the space bar on a keyboard or any of the buttons (ABXY / shapes) on a gamepad.
• To adjust options with a gamepad, use the D-pad (arrow buttons on the left side).


Thanks again for checking out my game, and for reading this far — I hope you enjoy it!
